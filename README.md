# counting-Human-faces
we will use image processing to detect and count the number of faces. We are not supposed to get all the features of the face. Instead, the objective is to obtain the bounding box through some methods i.e. coordinates of the face in the image, depending on different areas covered by the number of the coordinates, number faces that will be computed.
